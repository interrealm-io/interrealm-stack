Problem
 note *** autoDiscovery is set to false on the agents not sure if that is an issue
  The ping-pong test agents were failing to exchange events across realms (realm.alpha ↔ realm.beta). Events were being published but not
  delivered, showing "0 delivered" in server logs.

  Root Causes Identified

  1. Missing Event Subscription Handler

  File: nexus/server/src/gateway/gateway-manager.ts
  - The gateway wasn't handling event-subscribe messages from clients
  - SDK was sending subscription messages but server was logging "Unknown message type: event-subscribe"

  Fix: Added case handler at line 266-268:
  case 'event-subscribe':
    await this.eventHandler.handleEventSubscribe(memberId, payload);
    break;

  2. No Subscription Storage Implementation

  File: nexus/server/src/gateway/handlers/event.handler.ts
  - subscribeToEvent() method was only logging, not actually storing subscriptions
  - Event routing looks for eventHandlers in member's scannedContract, but they were never being saved

  Fix: Implemented full subscription storage (lines 216-255):
  - Retrieves member's contract from database
  - Adds event handler to contract.eventHandlers array
  - Updates member record with modified contract

  3. Incorrect Subscription Finder Logic

  File: nexus/server/src/gateway/handlers/event.handler.ts (lines 172-217)
  - Original code required contract.required to exist BEFORE checking eventHandlers
  - This meant even if subscriptions were stored, they wouldn't be found if no required field existed

  Fix: Reversed the logic priority:
  1. Check eventHandlers FIRST (explicit subscriptions)
  2. Fall back to required capabilities (implicit subscriptions)

  Current Status

  ✅ Completed:
  - Event subscription messages are received and handled
  - Subscriptions are stored in database successfully
  - Server logs confirm: "Member realm.beta/pong-member subscribed to test.ping-pong.Ping on ping-pong"
  - Subscription finder logic prioritizes explicit event handlers

  ❌ Still Investigating:
  - Events still showing "0 delivered" despite subscriptions being stored
  - Added debug logging to findEventSubscribers() to diagnose why stored subscriptions aren't being found
  - Possible issues:
    - Member status field may not be 'online'
    - Database query timing issue
    - Field mapping problem between subscription storage and retrieval

  2. /Users/looptix/Documents/GitHub/realm-mesh/nexus/server/src/gateway/handlers/event.handler.ts:172-255
  3. /Users/looptix/Documents/GitHub/realm-mesh/mvp/ping-pong/package.json (added reflect-metadata dependency)
  4. /Users/looptix/Documents/GitHub/realm-mesh/mvp/ping-pong/src/ping-agent.ts (fixed agent initialization order)
  5. /Users/looptix/Documents/GitHub/realm-mesh/mvp/ping-pong/src/pong-agent.ts (fixed agent initialization order)

  Next Steps

  1. Review debug logs from findEventSubscribers() to see why 0 members are returned
  2. Verify member status field is set to 'online' when connected
  3. Confirm scannedContract field structure matches what the finder expects
  4. Test with fresh agent connections after server properly restarts

  The infrastructure for cross-realm event routing is in place, but the final connection between stored subscriptions and event delivery needs
   debugging.
